Test Project

Summary
Write a simple messaging app that allows users to send and receive messages to and from other users. Implement the features listed below. 

Advanced styling is unnecessary, though the app must be functional and intuitive enough to use without guidance.
Ideally, we would like to receive the test project in 2-3 days. If it takes longer, let us know an ETA.

Stack
? Use Python + Django to create a REST API based backend that coordinates with the frontend
? Use whatever database type you would like (Sqlite, Postgres, whatever)
? Use React to create the frontend. Keep the UI user-friendly, simple and intuitive.
? Use any other packages, libraries, tools, etc you find useful
? Build the project to be deployed on Ubuntu

Tasks
? Develop the app
? Commit the project to a Github repository and send us the link
? Include a README file that includes any instructions we need to set up your project, any necessary external packages, and anything else that would affect getting your project to run on our Ubuntu server
? Deliver the project by the end of 2~3 days (the latest) from receiving these requirements

Requirements
The app should include the following features:
? Login screen
? Should be able to save authentication token to skip login after initial login

? List of messages received
? Ability to delete individual message
? Sent
? List of messages sent
? Ability to delete individual message
